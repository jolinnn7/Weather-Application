# Weather Application

The Weather Application is a simple and friendly web app that helps you check the weather for any city around the world. You can see today’s weather, a 5-day forecast, or even an hourly breakdown, all with just a few clicks. The app lets you choose your preferred temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and wind speed units (km/h or mph), so it’s easy to use no matter where you are.

Alongside weather updates, the app also keeps you informed about recent earthquakes with a live regional alert system. Everything is presented in a clear, easy-to-read format that works great on computers
