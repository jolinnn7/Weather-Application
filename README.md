# Weather Application

The Weather Application is a user-friendly platform designed to provide accurate and real-time weather forecasts, earthquake alerts, and air quality updates. With a sleek and responsive interface, users can easily access hourly, daily, and 5-day weather forecasts for any city/country worldwide. The application also features a dark mode, customizable units for temperature and wind speed, and a rotating weather fact section to keep users informed and engaged.

Additionally, the app integrates earthquake and alerts, local time updates, and curated weather-related news articles. By combining essential weather data with a visually appealing design, the Weather Application aims to be your go-to dashboard for staying informed about the environment around you.

# UX

The Weather Application is designed for individuals who want to stay informed about weather conditions, environmental alerts, and related news in a convenient and visually appealing way. The target audience includes travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone who needs accurate and timely weather updates to plan their day or stay safe during extreme conditions.

## Design Process

To ensure a seamless user experience, wireframes and mockups were created during the design phase. These visual guides helped in planning the layout, navigation, and overall functionality of the application. You can view the wireframes and mockups in the `design` directory of this project or access them [here](#). The design process focused on simplicity, responsiveness, and accessibility to cater to a wide range of users.

# Deployment

The Weather Application is deployed using **GitHub Pages** and is accessible at:  
[https://jolinnn7.github.io/Weather-Application/](https://jolinnn7.github.io/Weather-Application/)

## Deployment Process

1. **Repository Setup**
   - The project is stored in a public GitHub repository.
   - All source code, assets, and documentation are committed to the `main` branch.

2. **Building for Deployment**
   - Since this is a static web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), no build process is required.
   - All files in the repository are ready for deployment as-is.

3. **Deploying to GitHub Pages**
   - In the repository settings, GitHub Pages is enabled and set to deploy from the `main` branch (`/root` directory).
   - After pushing changes to GitHub, the site is automatically updated and available at the provided URL.
   
## Differences Between Deployed and Development Versions

- **API Keys:**  
  - **Development:** API keys for OpenWeatherMap and GNewsAPI are added locally for testing and development.
  - **Deployment:** API keys are removed or left blank in the public repository for security. Users must add their own API keys locally to run the app with full functionality.
- **Configuration Files:**  
  - No separate configuration files are used for deployment. All configuration is handled in the main codebase.
- **Git Branches:**  
  - Deployment is done from the `main` branch. No separate deployment branch is used.

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
